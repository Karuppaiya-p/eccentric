                Eccentric Network is mainly lused in software companies. Because many involve in
                completition of the oject like
                team leader, project leader. Team members should finish their dalily task and their
                source colde should be storedin the main server. This is the day-to-day&nbsp; task done by the team members.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Project
                Leader assigns modules for the team members. These are informed to the members manually
                If the team member or the team leader is not in the office they can't perform this
                task. So here we developed a private
                network for the team leader and the team member.<br />

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Using this network
                the project leader can assing the projects to the respective team members.This information
                &nbsp;contains with the team member network id and password with project name and
                the roll of the project and time
                duration of the project.Once an;y team member got the project assignment mail they
                interact with our private network and
                they do their daily task at any time</span></strong>.<br />
